## Audit Workflow
For each cosmology:
1. `node systematic_audit.js audit "Cosmology Name"`
2. Research core beliefs using methodology
3. Update `cosmology_features.json` with proper R/DB/NR assignments
4. Test in browser dropdown: `http://localhost:3000/test-quiz-engine`
5. Verify target cosmology ranks in top 3
6. Mark as ✅ in this checklist
7. Update summary statistics
