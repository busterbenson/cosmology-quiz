# Top Question Merge Candidates

Based on the similarity analysis, here are the most actionable merge opportunities:

## ðŸ”´ IMMEDIATE MERGE (100% Identical)

### 1. Young Earth Questions
**Current Questions:**
- "Do you believe the Earth is less than 10,000 years old?"
- "Do you believe a global flood was primarily responsible for shaping the Earth's geology?"

**Issue:** IDENTICAL cosmological impact patterns (100% match across all 110 cosmologies)

**Proposed Merged Question:**
"Do you believe the Earth is less than 10,000 years old and that major geological features were shaped by a global flood?"

**Rationale:** Both test the same Young Earth Creationist worldview with identical discriminatory power.

**Decision:** Keep "Do you believe the Earth is less than 10,000 years old?" and delete the one about the flood

## ðŸŸ¡ STRONG MERGE CANDIDATES (98%+ Similar)

### 2. Multiverse Questions  
**Current Questions:**
- "Do you believe our universe is one of many 'bubble' universes, each with potentially different physical laws?"
- "Do you believe our universe exists on a 'brane' (a membrane) within a higher-dimensional space?"

**Similarity:** 98.2% with 100% conceptual overlap (both test multiverse acceptance)

**Proposed Merged Question:**
"Do you believe our universe is one of many universes (whether as bubble universes, higher-dimensional branes, or other multiverse models)?"

**Decision:** Merge into "Do you believe our universe is one of many universes?"

### 3. Ancient Astronaut Questions
**Current Questions:**  
- "Do you believe that extraterrestrial beings intervened in human evolution, possibly through genetic engineering?"
- "Do you believe that extraterrestrials guided ancient civilizations, providing them with advanced knowledge?"

**Similarity:** 97.3% with high conceptual overlap

**Proposed Merged Question:**
"Do you believe that extraterrestrial beings have significantly influenced human history, whether through genetic intervention or guiding ancient civilizations?"

**Decision:** Merge into "Do you believe that extraterrestrial beings have significantly influenced human history and/or evolution?"

## ðŸŸ¢ KEEP SEPARATE (Despite High Similarity)

### High Similarity but Different Concepts
- **Young Earth vs Scientific Evidence** (99.1% similar)
  - Tests geological vs epistemological beliefs
  - Keep separate to distinguish between belief and evidence evaluation

- **Quantum Consciousness vs Neutral Monism** (98.2% similar)  
  - Tests different philosophical frameworks for mind-matter relationship
  - Keep separate for conceptual precision

## Impact Assessment

**Immediate Merge (1 pair):**
- Reduces quiz by 1 question with zero loss in discriminatory power
- Eliminates true redundancy

**Consider Merging (2 pairs):**
- Could reduce quiz by 2 more questions  
- Minimal loss in discrimination (98%+ identical patterns)
- Improves conceptual clarity

**Total Potential Reduction:** 3 questions (4% of current 73 questions)
**Maintained Accuracy:** >98% (only merging near-identical patterns)

This focused approach eliminates redundancy while preserving the quiz's comprehensive philosophical coverage.
