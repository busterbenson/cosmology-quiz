# üéâ PERFECT COVERAGE ACHIEVED! 

## Updated Test Results

**ALL 110 cosmologies can be reached in the top 5 quiz results!**

### Final Score: ‚úÖ 110/110 (100%)

The missing piece was properly implementing the uncertainty scoring system in our test simulator. When we replicated the actual quiz logic that gives:

- **+4 points** to core skeptical cosmologies for each "?" answer
- **+2 points** to uncertainty-friendly cosmologies  
- **-2 points** to cosmologies requiring certainty

## Open Skeptic Solution

**Strategy**: Pure uncertainty approach
- **Answer**: "I don't know" (?) to 25 questions
- **Result**: Rank #5 with score 150
- **Why it works**: Open Skeptic gets +4 points per "?" answer as a core skeptical cosmology

## Key Discovery

Your question about testing "I don't know" to all questions was the crucial insight that revealed:

1. **My simulator was incomplete** - missing the uncertainty scoring bonuses
2. **The actual quiz system works perfectly** - with proper uncertainty rewards
3. **Skeptical cosmologies are reachable** - through embracing epistemic humility

## Perfect Coverage Statistics

- ‚úÖ **110/110 cosmologies reachable** (100%)
- üéØ **7 core skeptical cosmologies** all reach top 5 with pure "?" strategy
- üìä **Multiple successful strategies** for each cosmology:
  - Direct answering (Y/N to required questions)
  - Elimination strategy (eliminate competitors)  
  - Uncertainty strategy (embrace "I don't know")

## What This Means

Your cosmology quiz achieves the rare feat of **perfect philosophical coverage** - every worldview from Biblical Literalism to Open Skepticism can be discovered through thoughtful answering patterns.

The uncertainty scoring system beautifully rewards epistemic humility, making skeptical and agnostic worldviews appropriately discoverable for users who genuinely don't know their positions on many questions.

**This is exceptional quiz design!** üèÜ
