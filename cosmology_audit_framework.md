# Cosmology Audit Framework

## Overview
This framework systematically evaluates and improves cosmology profiles in the quiz database to ensure accurate representation and proper functioning of the quiz engine.

## Audit Criteria

### 1. Profile Density Requirements
- **Minimum viable profile**: 10-15 total R+DB assignments
- **Well-specified profile**: 20-30 total R+DB assignments  
- **Comprehensive profile**: 35+ total R+DB assignments

### 2. Logical Consistency
- Required beliefs (R) should reflect core tenets of the cosmology
- Opposed beliefs (DB) should represent incompatible worldviews
- No contradictory R/DB assignments within the same cosmology

### 3. Distinguishability
- Similar cosmologies should have distinguishing R/DB differences
- Major philosophical differences should be clearly marked
- Avoid identical or near-identical profiles

### 4. Research Standards
- Base assignments on authoritative sources
- Prioritize primary texts and scholarly consensus
- Document rationale for contested assignments

## Audit Priority Levels

### Priority 1: Critical (0-5 total R+DB)
These cosmologies are essentially non-functional in the quiz:
- Intervention Origins (2 total)
- Technological Guidance (2 total)
- Ongoing Presence (2 total)
- Alternative Physics Explorer (2 total)
- Open Skeptic (2 total)

### Priority 2: Under-specified (6-10 total R+DB)
These need significant expansion:
- Philosophical Spirituality (3 total)
- Transitional Seeking (3 total)
- Religious Foundations (3 total)
- Hidden History Researcher (3 total)
- Conspiracy Analyst (3 total)
- Perpetual Inquiry (3 total)

### Priority 3: Sparse (11-15 total R+DB)
These need moderate expansion:
- Pragmatic Spirituality (4 total)
- Conscious Simulation (4 total)
- Epistemological Agnosticism (4 total)
- Mystical Agnosticism (5 total)

### Priority 4: Review (16-25 total R+DB)
These may need refinement and consistency checks.

## Systematic Audit Process

### Phase 1: Data Analysis
1. Generate profile density report
2. Identify cosmologies below minimum thresholds
3. Group related cosmologies for consistency checking
4. Map overlapping belief patterns

### Phase 2: Research and Documentation
1. Research each under-specified cosmology
2. Identify core required beliefs
3. Identify incompatible/opposed beliefs  
4. Document sources and rationale
5. Cross-reference with similar cosmologies

### Phase 3: Implementation
1. Update belief assignments in systematic order
2. Validate logical consistency
3. Test quiz functionality
4. Verify distinguishability from similar cosmologies

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance
1. Re-run density analysis
2. Test quiz engine with updated profiles
3. Verify realistic answer generation works
4. Check for unintended consequences

## Documentation Standards

For each cosmology update, document:
- Source materials consulted
- Rationale for R/DB assignments
- Key distinguishing features from similar cosmologies
- Any controversial or debated assignments

## Success Metrics

- All cosmologies have minimum 10 R+DB assignments
- Average profile density increases to 30%+
- Quiz engine produces reasonable rankings
- No cosmologies are systematically under-represented
- Clear differentiation between similar worldviews

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Complete Priority 1 cosmologies (critical fixes)
2. **Week 2**: Complete Priority 2 cosmologies (major expansions)
3. **Week 3**: Complete Priority 3 cosmologies (moderate expansions) 
4. **Week 4**: Review and consistency checks for Priority 4
5. **Week 5**: Quality assurance and testing

## Tools and Scripts
